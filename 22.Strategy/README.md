#### Strategy: Separates an algorithm into its ‘skeleton’ and concrete implementation steps, which can be varied at run-time.

Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher- and lower-level parts  

Making tea can be decomposed into
- The process of making a hot beverage (boil water, pour into cup); and
- Tea-specific things (put teabag into water)  

The high-level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate
- Supported by beverage-specific strategies
