#### FlyWeight: A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.  

E.g., Multiplayer RPG game
- Plenty of users with identical first/last names
- No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again
- Store a list of names and references to them (indices, pointers, etc.)

E.g., bold or italic text formatting
- Donâ€™t want each character to have a formatting character
- Operate on ranges (e.g., line number, start/end positions)
