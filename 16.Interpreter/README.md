#### Interpreter: A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).  

Textual input needs to be processed
- E.g., turned into linked structures
- AST = Abstract Syntax Tree  

Some examples
- Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
- HTML, XML and similar
- Numeric expressions (3+4/5)
- Regular expressions
