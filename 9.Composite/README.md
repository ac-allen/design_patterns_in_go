#### A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.

- Objects use other objectsâ€™ fields/methods through embedding   

- Composition lets us make compound objects  
 - E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or a shape group made of several different shapes  


- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly i.e. Foo and []Foo have common APIs
