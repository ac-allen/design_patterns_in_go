#### State: A pattern in which the object’s behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition).

Consider an ordinary telephone  
What you do with it depends on the state of the phone/line
- If it’s ringing or you want to make a call, you can pick it up
- Phone must be off the hook to talk/make a call
- If you try calling someone, and it’s busy, you put the handset down

Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event (Observer pattern)
